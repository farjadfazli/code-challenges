Z Sum

Given an n by n integer matrix, return the sum of all elements that form a Z in the matrix. For example, given:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The Z that's formed is [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9] and its sum is 35.

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 1000

Example 1

Input

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

Output

35
