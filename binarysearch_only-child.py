Only Child

Given a binary tree root, return the number of nodes that are an only child. A node x is an only child if its parent has exactly one child (x).

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root

Example 1
Input
Visualize

root = [0, [4, null, null], [2, [1, [3, null, null], null], null]]

Output

2

Explanation

Node 1 is an only child and 3 is an only child.
Example 2
Input
Visualize

root = [1, null, [3, [1, null, null], [1, null, null]]]

Output

1

Explanation

Node 3 is an only child
