Max Product

Given a list of integers, find the largest product of two distinct elements.
Example 1

Input

nums = [5, 1, 7]

Output

35

Explanation

35 is the largest product that can be made from 5 * 7
Example 2

Input

nums = [7, 1, 7]

Output

49

Explanation

49 is the largest product that can be made from 7 * 7. The values can be the same but they must be separate elements.
Example 3

Input

nums = [-5, 1, -7]

Output

35
