High frequency

Given a list of integers nums, find the most frequently occurring element and return the number of occurrences of that element.

For example, given the list [1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 1], return 5 since the the element 1 appears 5 times.

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
